- ### Setting up git environment
- **As a first-time set up, you need to tell Git who you are.**
- Enter these lines (with appropriate changes):
- ```sh
  git config --global user.name "Ouassim Abdelmalek Ghribi"
  git config --global user.email "oag@big-mama.io"
  ```
- > Make sure that you include here the same email you used for signing up on GitHub.
- Test if this worked by typing
- ```sh
  git config --list
  ```
-
- **You only need to do this once.**
-
- Next ==> [ssh-setup](./ssh-setup.md)
